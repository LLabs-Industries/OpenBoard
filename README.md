# OpenBoard

OpenBoard is a personal Arduino repository for storing code, circuits, and hardware experiments.  
This repo serves as a growing archive of sketches, prototypes, and rapid hardware concepts.

Everything here is shared openly and unlicensed — use it, modify it, break it, improve it.

## What’s Inside
- Arduino sketches and firmware
- Circuit designs and wiring notes
- Rapid prototypes and hardware experiments
- Miscellaneous embedded projects

## Credits & Resources
This work is built using:
- LLabs Industries system administrator code (Mr. Blueskys)
- Palm Beach Central High School engineering equipment and resources
- Rapid prototyping and production technology tools

## Circuit Schematics
<!-- Paste circuit diagrams, schematics images, or links below -->
Until i can figure out how to paste schematics onto the read me ill upload jpegs or PDFs on the project itself

## Instructions:
ill try to make this simple, On whatever system yor on windows linux mac whatever get Arduino Ide (or arduino CLI if you know that) then i personally recommend you recreate my circuit in tinkercad or wokwi and once you understand the hardware then you make the circuit in real life (I use R3 Arduino UNO's and breadboards) And then of course burn the code using Ardino ide onto your arduino and if everything went well itll all work probably. it is also worth noting i may use specific libraries MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THEM INSTALLED or it will not compile.
