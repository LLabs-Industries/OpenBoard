# OpenBoard

OpenBoard is a personal Arduino repository for storing code, circuits, and hardware experiments.  
This repo serves as a growing archive of sketches, prototypes, and rapid hardware concepts.

Everything here is shared openly and unlicensed — use it, modify it, break it, improve it.

## What’s Inside
- Arduino sketches and firmware
- Circuit designs and wiring notes
- Rapid prototypes and hardware experiments
- Miscellaneous embedded projects

## Credits & Resources
This work is built using:
- LLabs Industries system administrator code (Mr. Blueskys)
- Palm Beach Central High School (See extra credits)
- Rapid prototyping and production technology tools

## License
Unlicensed.  
This repository is released into the public domain — no warranty, no restrictions.

## Disclaimer

## Circuit Schematics
<!-- Paste circuit diagrams, schematics images, or links below -->
Until i can figure out how to paste schematics onto the read me ill upload jpegs or PDFs on the project itself

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Arduino IDE
Download and install the Arduino IDE (or Arduino CLI if you're comfortable with command-line tools) for your operating system (Windows, Linux, or Mac).

### Step 2: Simulate the Circuit
- Before building the physical circuit, I recommend simulating it first:
- Use Tinkercad or Wokwi to recreate the circuit
- This helps you understand the hardware components and connections

### Step 3: Build the Physical Circuit
Once you're comfortable with the simulation:
- Gather your components (Arduino UNO R3 and breadboard recommended)
- Recreate the circuit in real life following your simulation

### Step 4: Install Required Libraries
Before uploading code, make sure all necessary libraries are installed in Arduino IDE. Missing libraries will cause compilation errors.

### Step 5: Upload the Code
- Open the code in Arduino IDE
- Connect your Arduino board
- Upload (burn) the code to your Arduino

If everything is set up correctly, your project should work as expected.

## Extra Credits
Some development and testing was done using engineering lab resources at Palm Beach Central High School.
